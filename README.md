The \texttt{FunctionalEnrichmentAnalysis} R package is designed for comprehensive functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). It integrates Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis to provide insights into the biological significance of gene sets. The package uses established bioinformatics tools such as \texttt{clusterProfiler}, \texttt{enrichplot}, and \texttt{ggplot2} to generate high-quality visualizations.
